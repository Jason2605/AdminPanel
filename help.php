		<div class='panel-body'>
			<p>The players tab has a filter bar, exactly the same as a search bar, this allows you to seach for a

			<h3 class='panel-title'>Ban Menu</h3>
		</div>
		<div class='panel-body'>
			<p>Ban menu, this allows you to ban players who are in/out of game, with a reason and a time. The time is
				scaled in minutes, 60 = 1 hour. Note - When a player is banned they will remain in the server so please
				kick them straight after!</p>

	<div class='panel panel-info'>
		<div class='panel-heading'>
			<h3 class='panel-title'>Kick Menu</h3>
		</div>
		<div class='panel-body'>
			<p>Kick player, this has two options, RCON kick and Server kick. Server kick comes up with every single
				player who is in your database and all you need to do it hit kick, obviously they have to be on the
				server for it to kick them.</p>
			<p>RCON kick is a little more complicated however it does have the ability to give a reason for your kick.
				To kick someone you need the Battleye id for the player, this is found by clicking the battleye list
				button. This is the number you need to use to kick people from your server - Not their UID or thier
				GUID.</p>

	<div class='panel panel-info'>
		<div class='panel-heading'>
			<h3 class='panel-title'>Log Menu</h3>
		</div>
		<div class='panel-body'>
			<p>The logs tab shows you exactly which admin has done what at the exact time. Note - The timing will depend
				on where your database is situated!</p>

	<div class='panel panel-info'>
		<div class='panel-heading'>
			<h3 class='panel-title'>Thanks!</h3>
		</div>
		<div class='panel-body'>
			<p>The rest of the panel should hopefully be pretty self exploratory, however if you need any help then let
				me know! jasonhall96686@yahoo.com</p>
