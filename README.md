##AdminPanel Info
AdminPanel was a project started after owning a community and my admins not knowing fully how to use database admin tools, so I created a very user friendly panel instead!

The panel also has access to Rcon, meaning your server can be maintained and run without the need to be in-game or even your computer!

###Donate

Donations are much appreciated!

###Screenshots

See the AdminPanel in action <a href = "https://www.flickr.com/photos/140721778@N03/">here!</a> (Screenshots may be outdated at some point)

###Download

Download the latest version from <a href = "https://github.com/Jason2605/AdminPanel/releases">here!</a>

###Install

Just drop these files into a webserver. Everything else is configured from the panel itself so no need for file configuration!

Default user is Username: AdminPanel Password: Admin1234
Please change this after the first login.

Thanks for the support!
